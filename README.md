# Soil-Analysis-and-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-and-VNIR-Spectroscopy-Data

This project focuses on building predictive models to estimate Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) content using data from Visible Near Infrared (VNIR) spectroscopy.
SOC is a key indicator of soil fertility and quality, and accurate estimation of its content is critical for agricultural and environmental management.
We applied machine learning techniques to predict SOC based on spectroscopy data, leveraging various regression models and preprocessing techniques.
